## Purpose
This is a simple one-page app that helps second grader's practice addition. It is gamified so that students score 10 points per correct answer, and if they score 100 points (10 questions in a row) they win the game. 

## Development Requirements
Due to the simplistic nature of this app, it is intentionally lightweight. There are no dependencies necessary. 

To view, open the /addition/index.html page in a live server.
